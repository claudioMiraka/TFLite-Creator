# TFLite-Creator

Build ML model that can run on mobile devices without having an ML backgound!

This project uses [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker) to build models for object detection and image classification and [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) to create a data set.



### Getting Started

Each folder has its own readme file with the instructions. 

- [open_images_colletor](open_images_colletor) will create a data set.
- [object_detection/train](object_detection/train) will use the data set created to build an object detection model.
- [image_classifier/train](image_classifier/train) will use the data set created to build an image classifican model.
